# ttt2-emancipation-grill
A~~n~~ **FAILED** attempt to create a Portal Emancipation Grill for TTT2.

This shit dont work!

### Problems:
It has been a hot minute since I took linear algebra, and also thinking about 3d things is hard when your scripting API is this obtuse and *lua*.

IIRC:

- Weird client/server behavior mismatch.
- Weird issues with particles. The gmod API docs also did not match what the game said was actually available.
- Ditto on the API thing for some OBB trigger stuff.
- I think both of the above points got fixed like one patch after I gave up on this. what a shame.
